# Speech Programmer

Speech Programmer is a web app which generates code from speech. Current support is only for code in C language, and the speaker has to follow specific rules while speaking. You could try out the live app here(https://www.shreyasnisal.com/SpeechProgrammer/).

## Running the app

The app requires no installation at all. Once you clone/download the project, just open index.html in your web browser, and start using the app!
